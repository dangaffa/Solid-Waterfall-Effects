DEPENDENCIES (The mod will NOT work without these):

Requires RealPlume, RealPlume Stock*, Module Manager, Waterfall 0.8.X , Smokescreen, TUFX (I don't know why it just is)

*RealPlume stock only required if Restock is not installed

 

NOTE: ROCKET SOUND ENHANCEMENT WILL OVERRIDE THE SOUNDS PROVIDED BY THIS MOD

Thanks to:

Kochi (Original configs for Waterfall and RealPlume, and for making this Github)

Leopard (Module Manager Patches)

Lemoncup (Custom PhotonCorp Configs)
